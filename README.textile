h1. Murmur Ice-to-JSON gateway

Provides a basic framework to translate Murmur's Ice callbacks to requests to a web service to facilitate authentication.

h2. Setup

Configure icesecretwrite in mumble-server.ini.

Set 'secret' in jsongate.py:ice_auth

Find Murmur.ice and set MURMUR_SLICE_PATH (or let it default to /usr/share/slice/Murmur.ice; if you're on an rpm-based distro, just give up here).

Configure base_uri in murmur/json/authenticator.py.

h2. Data format

See murmur/json/authenticator.py's authenticate method's request_string variable for the POST variables you'll be getting.

Return a JSON dictionary that looks like:

{"id": 1, "newname": "", "groups": ["all"]}

Positive id is highly recommended.

newname is optional; if blank, no renaming occurs.

groups is also optional, but defaults to [] so you probably want to include "all".
